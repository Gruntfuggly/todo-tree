# Todo Tree

This extension quickly searches (using <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>) your workspace for comment tags like TODO and FIXME, and displays them in a tree view in the explorer pane. Clicking a TODO within the tree will open the file and put the cursor on the line containing the TODO.

Found TODOs can also be highlighted in open files.

*Note: The tree will only appear in the explorer pane when the extension finds some TODOs.*

## Highlighting

Highlighting tags is configurable. Use `defaultHighlight` to set up highlights for all tags. If you need to configure individual tags differently, use `customHighlight`. If settings are not specified in `customHighlight`, the value from `defaultHighlight` is used. If a setting is not specified in `defaultHighlight` then the older, deprecated `icon`, `iconColour` and `iconColours` settings are used.

Both `defaultHighlight` and `customHighlight` allow for the following settings:

`foreground` - used to set the foreground colour of the highlight in the editor and the marker in the ruler.

`background` - used to set the background colour of the highlight in the editor.

Foreground and background colours can be one of "red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "magenta", "cyan" or "grey". RGB values can also be used.

`icon` - used to set a different icon in the tree view. Must be a valid octicon - will default to a tick if it's not.

`iconColour` - used to set the colour of the icon in the tree. If not specified, it will try to use the foreground colour, the background colour and then the older settings, in that order.

`type` - used to control how much is highlighted in the editor. Valid values are:

 - `tag` - highlights just the tag
 - `text` - highlights the tag and any text after the tag
 - `line` - highlights the entire line containing the tag

Example:

```
"todo-tree.defaultHighlight": {
    "icon": "alert",
    "type": "text",
    "foreground": "red",
    "background": "white",
    "iconColour": "blue"
},
"todo-tree.customHighlight": {
    "TODO": {
        "icon": "check",
        "type": "line"
    },
    "FIXME": {
        "foreground": "black",
        "iconColour": "yellow"
    }
}
```

*Note: The highlight configuration is separate from the settings for the search. Adding settings in `customHighlight` does not automatically add the tags into `todo-tree.tags`.*

## Commands

To make it easier to configure the tags, there are two commands available:

**todo-tree: Add Tag** - allows entry of a new tag for searching

**todo-tree: Remove Tag** - shows a list of current tags which can be selected for removing

*Note: The Remove Tag command can be used to show current tags - just press Escape or Enter with out selecting any to close it.*

## Configuration

The extension can be customised as follows:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| todo-tree.rootFolder | <tt>""</tt> | The search starts in your current workspace folder (or the workspace of the currently selected file). Change this setting if you want to start somewhere else. You can include environment variables and also use ${workspaceFolder}. e.g. <tt>"todo-tree.rootFolder": "$&#123;workspaceFolder&#125;/test"</tt> or <tt>"todo-tree.rootFolder": "$&#123;HOME&#125;/project"</tt>. Note: Other open files (outside of the rootFolder) will be shown (as they are opened) with their full path in brackets.* |
| todo-tree.tags | <tt>["TODO","FIXME"]</tt> |This defines the tags which are recognised as TODOs. This list is automatically inserted into the regex. |
| todo-tree.regex | <tt>&#x22;&#x28;&#x28;&#x2f;&#x2f;&#x7c;&#x23;&#x7c;&#x3c;&#x21;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x7c;&#x3b;&#x7c;&#x2f;&#x5c;&#x5c;&#x2a;&#x29;&#x5c;&#x5c;&#x73;&#x2a;&#x28;&#x24;&#x54;&#x41;&#x47;&#x53;&#x29;&#x7c;&#x5e;&#x5c;&#x5c;&#x73;&#x2a;&#x2d;&#x20;&#x5c;&#x5c;&#x5b;&#x20;&#x5c;&#x5c;&#x5d;&#x29;&#x22;</tt> | This defines the regex used to locate TODOs. By default, it searches for tags in comments starting with <tt>&#47;&#47;</tt>, <tt>#</tt>, <tt>;</tt>, <tt>&lt;!--</tt> or <tt>&#47;*</tt>. This should cover most languages. However if you want to refine it, make sure that the <tt>($TAGS)</tt> is kept. The second part of the expression allows matching of Github markdown task lists. *Note: This is a <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/>">Rust regular expression</a>, not javascript.* |
| todo-tree.regexCaseSensitive | <tt>true</tt> | Set to false to allow tags to be matched regardless of case. |
| todo-tree.globs | <tt>[]</tt> | If you want to modify the files which are searched, you can define a list of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob">globs</a>.|
| todo-tree.ripgrep | <tt>""</tt> | Normally, the extension will locate ripgrep itself as and when required. If you want to use an alternate version of ripgrep, set this to point to wherever it is installed. |
| todo-tree.ripgrepArgs | <tt>""</tt> | Use this to pass additional arguments to ripgrep. e.g. <tt>"-i"</tt> to make the search case insensitive. *Use with caution!* |
| todo-tree.ripgrepMaxBuffer | <tt>200</tt> | By default, the ripgrep process will have a buffer of 200KB. However, this is sometimes not enough for all the tags you might want to see. This setting can be used to increase the buffer size accordingly. |
| todo-tree.icons<sup>1</sup> | <tt>{}</tt> | Use alternative icons from the octicon set for specific tags, e.g. <tt>{"TODO":"pin", "FIXME":"issue-opened"}</tt> |
| todo-tree.iconColour<sup>1</sup> | <tt>"green"</tt> | Use this to change the colour of the icon for TODOs in the tree. Can be hex (e.g. "#FF80FF" ) or one of <tt>"red"</tt>, <tt>"green"</tt>, <tt>"blue"</tt>, <tt>"yellow"</tt>, <tt>"magenta"</tt>, <tt>"cyan"</tt> or <tt>"grey"</tt>. |
| todo-tree.iconColours<sup>1</sup> | <tt>{}</tt> | Use this if you need different icon colours based on the type of tag. The colours can be hex codes, or from the list above, and the match can be a javascript regex. e.g. <tt>{"TODO": "#FF80FF","^BUG": "red"}</tt>. *Note: The colours are applied **after** the search results, so don't forget to modify todo-tree.tags if you want to add new tags!* |
| todo-tree.showInExplorer | <tt>true</tt> | The tree is now also available in the activity bar. If you no longer want to see it in the explorer view, set this to false. |
| todo-tree.filterCaseSensitive | <tt>false</tt> | Use this if you need the filtering to be case sensitive. *Note: this does not the apply to the search*. |
| todo-tree.highlight<sup>1</sup> | <tt>false</tt> | Set this to true to highlight tags in files. |
| todo-tree.highlightDelay | <tt>500</tt> | The delay before highlighting (milliseconds). |
| todo-tree.trackFile | <tt>true</tt> | Set to false if you want to prevent tracking the open file in the tree view. |
| todo-tree.defaultHighlight | <tt>{}</tt> | Set default highlights. E.g. `{"foreground":"white","background":"red","icon":"check","type":"text"}` |
| todo-tree.customHighlight | <tt>{}</tt> | Set highlights per tag. E.g. `{"TODO":{"foreground":"white","type":"text"},"FIXME":{"icon":"beaker"}}` |
| todo-tree.expanded<sup>1</sup> | <tt>false</tt> | Set to true if you want new trees to be expanded by default |
| todo-tree.flat<sup>1</sup> | <tt>false</tt> | Set to true if you want new trees to be flat by default |
| todo-tree.grouped<sup>1</sup> | <tt>false</tt> | Set to true if you want new trees to be grouped by default |

<sup>1</sup> Deprecated - Please use `todo-tree.defaultHighlight` and `todo-tree.customHighlight` instead.

<sup>2</sup> Only applies to new workspaces. Once the view has been changed in the workspace, the current state is stored.

### Excluding files and folders

To exclude folders from your search, use the `todo-tree.globs` setting. For example, if you want to ignore everything in subfolders called `dist`, set it to `[ "!dist" ]`.

For more information on glob patterns, see [here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).

*Note: By default, ripgrep ignores files and folders from your `.gitignore` or `.ignore` files. If you want to include these files, set* `todo-tree.ripgrepArgs` *to* `--no-ignore`.

## Known Issues

Grouping by tag will only work when your configuration defines the tags using the `todo-tree.tags` setting. Older versions of the extension had the tags directly defined in the `todo-tree.regex` whereas now, the regex replaces **$TAGS** with the contents of `todo-tree.tags`.

Grouping by tag doesn't work for markdown task list items as there is no tag to group with. The tree will show the files alongside the tag groups.

Tracking the file in the tree view does not work when grouping by tag (as there can be multiple entries for each file).

When there is no current workspace, default icons will be shown in the tree.
